<p><span id="DeltaPlaceHolderMain"><strong>2D <br />
</strong>Acronym for &quot;two dimensional,&quot; a term applied to computer 
 graphics that are &quot;flat.&quot; Typical desktop applications such 
 as word processors, spreadsheet programs, or other programs that manipulate 
 print or basic graphics (such as pictures or line art) are generally considered 
 to be operating within a 2D environment, even when they include simple 
 three dimensional elements, such as buttons.<br />
<br />
<strong>3D<br />
</strong>Acronym for &quot;three dimensional,&quot; referring to computer 
 graphics that appear to have volume and depth. Various modeling processes 
 take the representation of a 3D object provided by the computer program 
 and render it by using various lighting components, applying textures, 
 and setting layers of transparency or opacity as required in order to 
 produce a realistic representation of a 3D object on a 2D display.<br />
<br />
<strong>3DC™ Technology<br />
</strong>An AMD hardware-based compression technology that reduces the 
 size of 3D texture data, efficiently rendering more finely grained texture. 
 It significantly decreases the memory footprint of normal maps containing 
 information on how light reflects off textured surfaces, allowing game 
 programmers to include more texture and lighting details without affecting 
 performance.</span></p>
<h4 style="color: #000000;"><a name="A" style="color: #000000;">A</a></h4>
<p><strong>Audio Compression Manager (ACM)<br />
</strong>A standard interface for audio compression and signal processing 
 for Windows®. The ACM can be used by Windows programs to compress and 
 decompress WAV files, as well as apply DSP algorithms to audio data. <br />
<br />
<strong>ADC<br />
</strong>Acronym for &quot;Apple Display Connector,&quot; a type of video 
 connection found only with certain Apple displays. In addition to carrying 
 the video signal to the monitor, it also carries power so users can start 
 their whole computer using the power button on the monitor. This type 
 of connector has been largely phased out in favor of DVI connectors.<br />
<br />
<strong>AGP<br />
</strong>Acronym for &quot;Accelerated Graphics Port,&quot; a slot on the 
 computer motherboard designed specifically for 3D graphics cards. AGP 
 runs 3D images much more smoothly and quickly than the PCI technology 
 that it replaced; AGP runs at several times the bus speed of PCI and employs 
 sideband addressing, so multiple data transfers between the graphics processor 
 and the computer can take place concurrently. AGP has been largely phased 
 out in favor of <br />
PCI Express® (PCIe®) ports.<br />
<br />
<strong>Alpha Blending<br />
</strong>Alpha blending is used in 3D graphics to create transparent or 
 opaque effects for surfaces such as glass and water. Alpha is a transparency 
 value, so the lower the value, the more transparent the image looks. It 
 is also used in animations to produce such things as fading effects, where 
 one image gradually fades into another.<br />
<br />
<strong>Alternate Frame Rendering<br />
</strong>A graphical load-balancing scheme where two graphics cards are 
 used to render alternate frames of the display. This configuration increases 
 the detail of the 3D objects each card can render, as each card handles 
 half of the total number of frames. Essentially, each card has more time 
 to render a scene, delivering a noticeable increase in 3D detail. This 
 type of graphical operation is only available in AMD CrossFire™ graphics 
 cards running DirectX® and OpenGL games or applications. <br />
<br />
<strong>AMD Cool 'n' Quiet™ Technology<br />
</strong>AMD Cool 'n' Quiet technology automatically scales performance 
 on-demand to provide extra performance and lower power consumption when 
 it is needed. <br />
<br />
<strong>AMD CrossFire™ Technology <br />
</strong>AMD technology that enables two or more discrete graphics processors 
 to work together to improve system performance. <br />
<br />
<strong>AMD Dynamic Switchable Graphics<br />
</strong>AMD Dynamic Switchable Graphics is a technology for mobile users. 
 Discrete graphics automatically activate when 3D applications or browser 
 video plug-ins start and when exiting applications graphics switch automatically 
 to power-savings mode. It is currently available on AMD Radeon™ HD 6000M 
 series graphics.<br />
<strong>AMD Eyefinity <br />
</strong>AMD Eyefinity is an AMD technology that supports multiple, independent 
 display outputs. This technology essentially enables two or more displays 
 to be simultaneously enabled on a single graphics card. The maximum number 
 of display outputs that can be supported varies depending on the connectivity 
 used for your displays. <br />
<br />
<strong>AMD HD3D <br />
</strong>AMD HD3D is a technology designed to enable Stereoscopic 3D support 
 in games, movies and/or photos.&#160;&#160;Additional hardware (e.g. 3D 
 enabled panels, 3D-enabled glasses/emitter, Blu-ray 3D drive) and/or software 
 (e.g. Blu-ray 3D discs, 3D middleware, games) are required for the enablement 
 of AMD HD3D.</p>
<p><strong>AMD Overdrive™ Technology<br />
</strong>A technology that maximizes the performance of a GPU by dynamically 
 altering its speed to an optimal level depending on usage. An on-chip 
 thermal sensor monitors the temperature of the GPU, allowing for maximum 
 clock speed to be maintained while avoiding overheating.<br />
<br />
<strong>AMD Radeon™ Dual Graphics<br />
</strong>AMD Radeon Dual Graphics allows AMD APUs and selected AMD Radeon 
 discrete graphics cards to work together to deliver performance that is 
 better than either device alone. It is currently supported on the AMD 
 A-Series APUs in conjunction with selected AMD Radeon HD 6000 series graphics 
 cards when used with the Microsoft Windows 7 operating system. <br />
<br />
<strong>AMD Vision Engine<br />
</strong>Leveraging AMD Radeon Cores, Video Accelerator and Software to 
 enable smooth 1080p HD playback, accelerated Web Browsing and accelerated 
 Media Applications.</p>
<p><strong>Anisotropic Filtering<br />
</strong>A technique that preserves the surface details of an object as 
 it recedes into the distance by utilizing and blending together the object’s 
 texture maps. This makes 3D objects appear more realistic as the detail 
 of their surface texture is retained in a smooth, seamless fashion on 
 the sections that move or fade away into the background.<br />
<br />
<strong>Anti-aliasing<br />
</strong>A method that smooths out the jagged edges of a curved object. 
 A black curved line on a white background displayed on a computer screen 
 will have some jaggedness along its edges due to the inherent limitations 
 of using discrete pixels to display the image. Anti-aliasing smoothes 
 out this jaggedness by filling in the white spaces between the jagged 
 edges with varying shades of grey.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">AOVs<br />
</span>AOVs (Arbitrary Output Variables) provide a way to render any arbitrary 
 shading network component&#160;into different images. &#160;For example, 
 an artist might find it convenient to separate direct and indirect lighting 
 contributions and later recombine them during compositing.&#160;</p>
<p><br />
<strong>APU<br />
</strong>Acronym for &quot;Accelerated Processing Unit.&quot; AMD APUs 
 combines the capabilities of the CPU and GPU on a single silicon die.<br />
<br />
<strong>Aspect Ratio<br />
</strong>The proportions of a display are expressed as a ratio of its width 
 and height. Common ratios include 4:3 for TVs and CRTs, 5:4 for LCDs, 
 and 16:9 for widescreen displays.<br />
<br />
<strong>AMD Avivo™ Technology<br />
</strong>ATI Avivo is a set of hardware and low level software features 
 designed to off load video decoding, encoding, and post-processing from 
 a computer's CPU to a compatible GPU. ATI Avivo compatible GPUs have lower 
 CPU usage when a player and decoder software that supports ATI Avivo is 
 used. The new name for this technology is “AMD Media Codec”.</p>
<p><strong>AMD Avivo Color<br />
</strong>A feature within Catalyst™ Control Center, providing the user 
 with control over how color is displayed on a monitor. Avivo Color provides 
 tools to adjust the Hue, Saturation and Color Temperature values on a 
 per-monitor basis.</p>
<h4 style="color: #000000;"><a name="B" style="color: #000000;">B</a></h4>
<p><strong>Back Buffer<br />
</strong>A type of off-screen memory used to provide smooth video and 2D 
 graphics acceleration. This technique uses two frame buffers, so the process 
 is often referred to as &quot;double-buffering.&quot; While the contents 
 of one buffer are displayed, a second buffer, called the &quot;back&quot; 
 buffer, holds the frame being worked on. In this way users will only see 
 complete, smooth frames displayed on screen.<br />
<br />
<strong>Bilinear Filtering<br />
</strong>This filtering method reduces the blockiness caused when zooming 
 into a 3D surface that is at a right angle to the viewer. A newspaper 
 photo examined closely enough will show that the picture is made up of 
 tiny dots. If the photo was enlarged it would start to look &quot;blocky&quot; 
 and less distinct. This is also a problem for computer-generated images, 
 especially for surface details.<br />
<br />
<strong>Bit Depth<br />
</strong>The number of data bits used to store color information about 
 a pixel. Larger bit depth means a greater range of color information is 
 capable of being encoded into each pixel. For example, 1 binary bit of 
 memory can only encode to either &quot;0&quot; or &quot;1&quot;. So a 
 graphical bit depth of 1 means that the display can only show two colors, 
 such as the black or white of a monochrome display. <br />
<br />
Four-bit color depth is capable of displaying 16 colors because there are 
 only 16 different combinations of 4 bits (&quot;0000&quot;, &quot;0001&quot;, 
 &quot;0010&quot;... to &quot;1111&quot;).<br />
<br />
16-bit color is capable of reproducing 65,536 colors, 24-bit color (where 
 8 bits are allocated to red, green, and blue each) can display up to 16.8 
 million individual colors, and 30-bit color (10 bits each) can display 
 over to 1 billion individual colors. Note that &quot;32-bit&quot; color 
 is usually 24-bit color with additional space allocated for other information, 
 such as alpha. <br />
<br />
High-end AMD workstation graphics accelerators can support higher bit depths, 
 including 40-bit and 64-bit color.<br />
<br />
<strong>Bitmap<br />
</strong>A graphic or character representation composed of individual pixels, 
 arranged horizontally in rows. A monochrome bitmap uses one bit per pixel 
 (bpp). Color bitmaps may use up to 32 bpp, depending on the color depth 
 selected.</p>
<p><strong>Brightness<br />
</strong>The amount of white or black that is applied to all colors on 
 screen. By making the screen &quot;brighter&quot; you are adding more 
 white to it. This should not be confused with luminosity, which measures 
 the actual light level emitted from the computer display.<br />
<br />
<strong>Buffer<br />
</strong>A name referring to portions of on-board video memory. One large 
 buffer is always used to display images to the screen; this is the &quot;display 
 buffer.&quot; The rest of off-screen memory is typically used by applications 
 as ack buffers, z-buffers, and texture buffers.</p>
<h4 style="color: #000000;"><a name="C" style="color: #000000;">C</a></h4>
<p><strong>Catalyst™ A.I.Technology<br />
</strong>Enables 3D driver optimization per application.</p>
<p><strong>Charisma Engine™ II Technology<br />
</strong>Incorporating a programmable Vertex Shader pipeline, Charisma 
 Engine II is a transform and lighting engine designed to make 3D characters 
 and transitions more life-like.</p>
<p><strong>Color Component<br />
</strong>Three color components—Red, Green, and Blue—combine in various 
 intensities to determine the color of each pixel on the screen. The values 
 of each color component are graphically represented by a corresponding 
 color curve.<br />
<br />
<strong>Color Correction<br />
</strong>Correct discrepancies between the real color value and the way 
 a screen displays it. Color discrepancies can be caused by a variety of 
 sources, including the lighting conditions in the work area and gradual 
 shifts in color over time on monitors or flat panel displays.<br />
<br />
<strong>Color Curve<br />
</strong>A color curve represents all possible intensity values (from 0 
 to 255) for a color component (Red, Green or Blue). For each color curve, 
 the horizontal axis represents the input value (the color value a program 
 wants to display), while the vertical axis represents the output value 
 (the color value that the display driver will write to the screen). A 
 value of 0 (in the lower left corner) represents the complete absence 
 of that particular color, while a value of 255 (in the upper right corner) 
 represents the &quot;full&quot; strength for that color.<br />
<br />
<strong>Color Depth<br />
</strong>Color depth refers to the number of color shades available on 
 your display and is measured in bits per pixel (bpp). Typical ranges are: 
 256 colors (8 bpp), thousands of colors (16 bpp), and millions of colors 
 (32 bpp).<br />
<br />
<strong>Color Temperature<br />
</strong>Color temperature is a measure that compares an individual color 
 or range of colors to the light radiated from an equivalent incandescent 
 black body at a given temperature in degrees Kelvin. An incandescent black 
 body that radiates at 1850 K (such as a candle) will appear orange, while 
 a household light bulb radiating at 2800 K appears yellow-white, and the 
 blue of lightly overcast sky is equivalent to an object radiating light 
 when heated to 7000 K. Adjusting color temperature enables a user to set 
 a monitor to best suit ambient lighting conditions.<br />
<br />
<strong>Component Video<br />
</strong>A standard Red/Green/Blue (RGB) color signal for televisions typically 
 used on DVD players and HDTV systems. The signal is split and compressed 
 into separate luminance and color values—luminance (&quot;Y&quot;), red 
 minus luminance (R-Y), and blue minus luminance (B-Y). The value for green 
 is not transmitted. The display device automatically &quot;fills in&quot; 
 the color values that are not red or blue. DVDs are encoded using component 
 video so display devices will provide enhanced playback when this type 
 of connection is used. A common variant of this format used in North America 
 is YPbPr.<br />
<br />
<strong>Composite Video<br />
</strong>A type of analog video signal that combines both brightness and 
 color information into a single signal. It typically uses a single RCA 
 connection for the video channel, and separate RCA connections for the 
 left and right audio channels. The quality of the video signal is reduced 
 by the process of mixing the brightness and multiple color channels together 
 into a single channel. For this reason it is inferior in signal quality 
 than either S-Video or component video. Composite video is the broadcast 
 format for analog television signals worldwide, and connections are typically 
 available on VCRs, DVD players and video games.<br />
<br />
<strong>Control Center<br />
</strong>The Control Center software application contains settings for 
 accessing and configuring all driver features available for your AMD product. 
 The name of the application varies depending on the AMD product and operating 
 system you are using: </p>
<ul style="list-style: disc;">
	<li><p>AMD VISION Engine Control Center—Available for AMD computing 
	 platforms installed with the AMD APU or AMD CPUs and AMD Radeon graphics 
	 cards.</p></li>

	 cards.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="text-align: left;"><strong>Control Point<br />
</strong>A user-created point on the color curve. Users can change the 
 color of the screen by moving the control points with a mouse.<br />
<br />
<strong>CPU<br />
</strong>Acronym for &quot;Central Processing Unit.&quot; The CPU performs 
 instruction, logical, and mathematical processing as well as other general 
 computing in a computer.</span></p>
<p><strong>CRT<br />
</strong>Acronym for &quot;cathode ray tube,&quot; which is the main component 
 of computer monitors and TVs. Color CRTs use three separate electron beams 
 fired through a shadow mask and onto the back of the glass screen. The 
 electron beams activate separate red, green, and blue values in various 
 strengths in order to produce a colored image. </p>
<h4 style="color: #000000;"><a name="D" style="color: #000000;">D</a></h4>
<p><strong>Decal<br />
</strong>A texture that is rendered directly as a visual. Decals are rendered 
 into a viewport-aligned rectangle. <br />
<br />
<strong>DFP<br />
</strong>Acronym for &quot;digital flat-panel&quot;, which is includes 
 digital display devices such as LCD monitors connected through a DVI, 
 DisplayPort, or HDMI™ connection. DFP can also be used to refer to digital 
 TVs (DTVs). <br />
<br />
<strong>Direct 3D<br />
</strong>Part of Microsoft's DirectX API designed for rendering 3D graphics 
 on Windows systems. It provides software developers with low-level access 
 to functions on graphics cards, providing the type of performance necessary 
 for intensive 3D applications such as games.<br />
<br />
<strong>Display Data Channel (DDC)<br />
</strong>A bi-directional communication between PC monitors and video adapters. 
 The monitor continuously sends its Extended Display Identification Data 
 (EDID) message to the video adapter. The message contains information 
 about the specification of the monitor. This enables the video adapter 
 to automatically select the highest resolution supported by a monitor 
 and prevent users from selecting unsupported modes. <br />
<br />
<strong>DisplayPort<br />
</strong>A digital display interface/connector designed to replace the 
 DVI interface. DisplayPort supports up to 10.8 Gbits per second data transfer. 
 DisplayPort is also designed as an alternative to HDMI™; it carries both 
 audio and video signals and as of version 1.1 supports HDCP. DisplayPort 
 supports both external and internal display connections.<br />
<br />
<strong>Dithering<br />
</strong>A computer graphics technique that takes advantage of the human 
 eye’s tendency to mix two colors that are adjacent to each other to produce 
 smooth boundary transitions. Dithering adds intermediate color values 
 between two or more boundaries, producing smoother, more natural look 
 to 2D images or 3D objects.</p>
<p><strong>Dot Pitch<br />
</strong>A measure of the sharpness of a monitor’s display. Dot pitch is 
 measured in millimeters (mm) and is the distance between the individual 
 phosphor sub-pixels in a CRT display or cells of the same color within 
 an LCD display. The smaller the number, the sharper the image. The most 
 common dot pitches for monitors range from .24 mm to .31 mm. Also, if 
 a monitor with a .24 mm dot pitch is set to its highest possible resolution, 
 the pixel size will equal the dot pitch. If the monitor is set to lower 
 resolutions, the pixels will be comprised of multiple dots.<br />
<br />
<strong>Digital Signal Processor (DSP)<br />
</strong>A specialized digital microprocessor used to perform calculations 
 on digitized signals that were originally analog in form (e.g. voice). 
 The big advantage of DSP lies in the programmability of the processor, 
 allowing parameters to be easily changed. <br />
<br />
<strong>DVI<br />
</strong>Acronym for &quot;Digital Video Interface,&quot; a standard video 
 connection used on many current computer displays. There are three types 
 of DVI connections: DVI-A (analog), DVI-D (digital), and DVI-I (integrated, 
 capable of either analog or digital). DVI supports bandwidth video signals 
 over 160 Hz, so it is most often used for high-resolution displays.</p>
<h4 style="color: #000000;"><a name="E" style="color: #000000;">E</a></h4>
<p><span id="DeltaPlaceHolderMain5"><strong>Extended Display Identification 
 Data (EDID)<br />
</strong>A data that contains basic information about a monitor and its 
 capabilities. The information is stored in the display and is used to 
 communicate with the system through a Display Data Channel (DDC). The 
 system uses this information for configuration purposes, so the monitor 
 and system can work together. </span></p>
<h4><a name="F">F</a></h4>
<p><span id="DeltaPlaceHolderMain6"><strong>Flat Shading<br />
</strong>A lighting technique that shades each polygon of a 3D object based 
 on where the source of the light is and the angle of the polygon in relation 
 to it. It enables relatively fast rendering of 3D objects, although it 
 can make those objects appear &quot;faceted&quot; as each visible polygon 
 is set to a particular color value, and consequently does not produce 
 as realistic an effect as obtained when using Gouraud shading. <br />
<br />
<strong>Fog<br />
</strong>Term used to describe the blending of an object using a fixed 
 color as objects are made to appear more distant from the viewer.<br />
<br />
<strong>Frame Buffer<br />
</strong>The portion of the memory buffer on the graphics card used to 
 store the image being displayed. All rendering processes have been accomplished 
 by this stage and this buffer contains only a one-to-one relationship 
 of the data to be relayed to the display.<br />
<br />
<strong>Frames Per Second<br />
</strong>In terms of 3D graphics, refers to the rate at which the graphic 
 processor can render new screens per second. Higher rates equals better, 
 more naturalistic performance for such things as games set in a 3D environment. 
 Sometimes abbreviated to &quot;fps&quot;.<br />
<br />
<strong>Framelock<br />
</strong>Technology used for simulation, visualization and power walls. 
 It optionally allows systems to be synchronized (Genlocked) to an external 
 signal, a capability essential for use in powerwalls used in live television 
 broadcasts.</span></p>
<h4><a name="G">G</a></h4>
<p><span id="DeltaPlaceHolderMain7"><strong>Gamma<br />
</strong>Sometimes confused with brightness, gamma actually refers to the 
 correction that is applied to any display device in order to produce more 
 gradual increases or decreases in the perceived brightness for that device. 
 A change in gamma produces a non-linear change in the color curve, ensuring 
 that perceived changes in color and intensity are consistently applied.<br />
<br />
<strong>Genlock<br />
</strong>Technology used for broadcast, non-linear editing (NLE) and other 
 video workflows. This allows the output of attached GPUs to be fed into 
 video-centric devices (e.g. monitors used in broadcast applications, or 
 NLE suites).<br />
<br />
<strong>GPU<br />
</strong>Acronym for &quot;Graphics Processing Unit.&quot; The GPU powers 
 the operations of a graphics card including support for 2D/3D and video. 
 A GPU can be embedded directly on the motherboard (integrated GPU) or 
 on an individual graphics card (discrete GPU). The terms &quot;GPU&quot; 
 and &quot;graphics processor&quot; are used interchangeably.<br />
<br />
<strong>Graphics Core Next (GCN)<br />
</strong>GCN an AMD technology implemented in the AMD Radeon HD 7000 series 
 graphics products. The GCN Architecture is designed for improved utilization, 
 which ensures that the GPU is making optimal use of its resources for 
 maximum performance.<br />
<br />

<br />
<strong>Group<br />
</strong>A container that lists related features in the Control Center 
 application. For example, the Power group contains all settings that relate 
 directly to the video playback, video quality, and video color.</span></p>
<h4><a name="H">H</a></h4>
<p><strong>HDCP<br />
</strong>Acronym for &quot;High-bandwidth Digital Copy Protection.&quot; 
 It is a form of digital rights management designed to protect copyright 
 of content being transported across DVI or HDMI connections. Several international 
 regulatory bodies have recommended its incorporation into high-definition 
 display and playback devices.<br />
<br />
<strong>HDMI™ Technology<br />
</strong>Acronym for &quot;High Definition Multimedia Interface.&quot; 
 It is a 19-pin connector used for transferring combined digital audio 
 and video. HDMI supports standard, enhanced, and high-definition digital 
 video signals, and is designed for use with VCRs, DVD players, personal 
 computers, and set-top boxes. A DVI adapter can be used to transfer the 
 video signal to an HDMI-capable display, although audio must be transferred 
 from a different route, as DVI output does not support audio.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">HDRI</p>
<p id="term-high-dynamic-range-image">High Dynamic Range Image is a set 
 of techniques that allow a far greater dynamic range of exposures than 
 normal digital imaging techniques. The intention is to accurately represent 
 the wide range of intensity levels found in real scenes, ranging from 
 direct sunlight to the deepest shadows.</p>
<p><br />
<strong>HDTV<br />
</strong>Acronym for &quot;High Definition Television,&quot; a format that 
 produces enhanced picture quality in a wide-screen format that matches 
 that of a movie theater screen. The two most popular formats are 1080i 
 and 720p, where the number represents how many horizontal scan lines they 
 have, and the following letter represents whether the picture is interlaced, 
 or the product of progressive scanning technology. Interlaced displays 
 paint the odd-numbered scan lines and then the even-numbered lines to 
 produce a picture, whereas progressive scan paints all of the scan lines 
 at once. Both formats use an aspect ratio of 16:9. In contrast, standard 
 North American television signals are displayed using 480 interlaced (480i) 
 scan lines with a more square aspect ratio of 4:3.</p>
<p><strong>Hue<br />
</strong>Refers to a specific color within the visible spectrum of light, 
 defined by its dominant wavelength. A light wave with a central tendency 
 within the range of 565-590 nm is visible as yellow. In the standard RGB 
 color space used by most computer displays, hue refers to a coordinate 
 of the color as described by its red, green, and blue values, minus any 
 additional brightness or saturation values for that color.<br />

<strong>HydraVision™ Software<br />
</strong>HydraVision is AMD's multi-monitor management software, enabling 
 users to manage the display of multiple windows and applications across 
 two or more adjacent monitors. It also includes a range of productivity 
 features designed to effectively manage applications in this environment. 
 HydraVision is available only if the HydraVision software component is 
 installed with the Control Center software.</p>

<h4><a name="L">L</a></h4>
<p><span id="DeltaPlaceHolderMain9"><strong>LCD Overdrive<br />
</strong>AMD technology that compensates for monitor response time or latency 
 when displaying video using overlays. A slow response time can create 
 a streaking effect that can occur on moving images displayed on a slower 
 than optimal monitor. LCD Overdrive is designed to minimize this problem. 
 LCD Overdrive enables a pixel to change from shade to shade more quickly 
 by either boosting or decreasing the luminosity of the requested pixel 
 value and applying the modified value to the pixel. This decreases the 
 difference between the before and after pixel values and the amount of 
 time required for the pixel to change state. <br />
<br />
<strong>Lighting<br />
</strong>In 3D computer graphics, refers to aspects and quality of the 
 virtual light source being used to make an object visible. Lighting can 
 strongly affect the &quot;mood&quot; of a scene. For example, a &quot;harsh&quot; 
 light could be a bare light bulb that is glaringly bright on the objects 
 closest to it while casting strong shadows in the background. A &quot;softer&quot; 
 light would be more diffuse and not cast shadows, such as you would get 
 outdoors on a typical overcast day.</span></p>
<h4><a name="M">M</a></h4>
<p><span id="DeltaPlaceHolderMain10"><strong>Mipmapping<br />
</strong>The most memory-intensive aspect of 3D graphics are the textures 
 that give an object its realism (like wood, marble, leather, and cloth). 
 Because objects in real life become less detailed as they move farther 
 away from the viewer, 3D programmers simulate this by using less detailed, 
 lower resolution texture maps on distant objects. These texture maps are 
 merely scaled down versions of the main texture map used when the object 
 is up close, and they use less memory.<br />
<br />
<strong>Multiview Video Coding (MVC)<br />
</strong>MVC is an amendment to H.264/MPEG-4 AVC video compression standard 
 that enables efficient encoding of sequences captured simultaneously from 
 multiple cameras using a single video stream. MVC is intended for encoding 
 stereoscopic (two-view) video, as well as free viewpoint television and 
 multi-view 3D television. MVC toolset is used in stereoscopic Blu-ray 
 3D releases. MVC stream is backward compatible with H.264/AVC, which allows 
 older devices and software to decode stereoscopic video streams, ignoring 
 additional information for the second view.</span></p>
<h4><a name="N">N</a></h4>
<p><span id="DeltaPlaceHolderMain11"><strong>NTSC<br />
</strong>The name for the type of analog television signal used throughout 
 the Americas (except Brazil) and in Japan. It draws a total of 525 vertical 
 interlaced frames of video at a refresh rate of 60 Hz, making it relatively 
 flicker-free. The acronym refers to the National Television Systems Committee, 
 which devised this color video standard in 1953.</span></p>
<h4><a name="O">O</a></h4>
<p><span id="DeltaPlaceHolderMain12"><strong>Off-screen Memory<br />
</strong>An area of memory used to preload images so that they can be quickly 
 drawn to the screen. Off-screen memory refers to all of the remaining 
 video memory not taken up by the front buffer, which holds the contents 
 of the display screen currently visible.<br />
<br />
<strong>OpenGL<br />
</strong>Short for &quot;Open Graphics Library,&quot; this is an industry 
 standard for cross-platform 3D graphics development. It consists of a 
 large number of functions that can be called upon in various programs, 
 such as games, CAD, and virtual-reality systems, to produce complex 3D 
 objects from simpler, more &quot;primitive&quot; building blocks. Implementations 
 currently exist under Windows, MacOS X, and various forms of Unix, including 
 Linux®.</span></p>
<p><span id="DeltaPlaceHolderMain12" style="font-weight: bold;">O</span><span 
	 style="font-weight: bold;">penCL</span><br />
<span id="DeltaPlaceHolderMain12">O</span>pen Computing Language is a framework 
 for writing programs that execute across heterogeneous platforms consisting 
 of central processing units (CPUs), graphics processing units (GPUs), 
 digital signal processors (DSPs), <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&#160;</span>field-programmable 
 gate arrays (FPGAs) and other processors or hardware accelerators. OpenCL 
 specifies a programming language (based on C99) for programming these 
 devices and application programming interfaces (APIs) to control the platform 
 and execute programs on the compute devices. OpenCL provides a standard 
 interface for parallel computing using task-based and data-based parallelism.</p>
<h4><a name="P">P</a></h4>
<p><span id="DeltaPlaceHolderMain13"><strong>PAL<br />
</strong>Acronym for &quot;Phase Alternating Line,&quot; the name for a 
 video broadcast standard used in much of Europe (except France), most 
 of Asia, the Middle-East, Africa, and Australia. It draws a total of 625 
 vertical interlaced frames of video at a refresh rate of 25 Hz.<br />
<br />
<strong>PCI<br />
</strong>Acronym for &quot;Peripheral Component Interconnect,&quot; which 
 is the specification for a type of computer bus used for attaching computer 
 peripherals to a computer’s motherboard. PCI encompasses both integrated 
 motherboard components (such as built-in graphical processors) and peripherals 
 that fit into an expansion card slot, such as a separate graphics card. 
 PCI replaced the older ISA and VESA bus standards and was itself superseded 
 by the AGP standard for the main graphics card bus.<br />
<br />
<strong>PCI Express® (PCIe®)<br />
</strong>The successor standard to the PCI and AGP bus standards, with 
 a significantly faster serial communications system, further opening up 
 bandwidth for more communications between such peripherals as graphics 
 cards and the computer’s CPU. PCIe cards can come in several physical 
 configurations, the fastest currently being ×16, which is typically used 
 for graphic cards, and ×1, typically used for other peripherals, such 
 as separate multimedia cards.<br />
<br />
<strong>Pipeline<br />
</strong>In relation to computer graphic processors, refers to the number 
 of separate arithmetic units available for rendering the output on a display. 
 In general, more pipelines available on a graphical processor means there 
 are more 3D rendering capabilities available, increasing overall 3D performance.<br />
<br />
<strong>Pixel<br />
</strong>All computer images are made up of tiny dots; each individual 
 dot is called a pixel, a word created from the term &quot;picture element.&quot; 
 A pixel is the smallest indivisible unit of a digital image and can be 
 only a single color. The size of the pixel depends on how the display 
 resolution has been set. The smallest size a pixel can be is determined 
 by the display’s dot pitch, which is measured in millimeters (mm).<br />
<br />
<strong>Pixel Tapestry™ II Technology<br />
</strong>A technology that uses four parallel, highly optimized rendering 
 pipelines, each capable of handling two textures simultaneously. It provides 
 advanced texturing, making 3D surfaces look more detailed and realistic.<br />
<br />
<strong>PowerPlay™ Technology<br />
</strong>A power management technology designed to dramatically reduce 
 power consumption for AMD Mobility Radeon family of mobile graphics products. 
 It provides an optimal balance between performance and power, delivering 
 high-performance when required and conserving battery power when demand 
 on the graphics processor is low.</span></p>
<h4><a name="Q">Q</a></h4>
<h4><a name="R">R</a></h4>
<p><span id="DeltaPlaceHolderMain14"><strong>Random Access Memory (RAM) 
 <br />
</strong>A data storage device for which the order of access to different 
 locations does not affect the speed of access. Data is typically stored 
 in RAM temporarily for use by the process or while the computer is operating. 
 <br />
<br />
<strong>Refresh Rate<br />
</strong>Also referred to as &quot;vertical refresh rate,&quot; this is 
 the rate at which a monitor or television can redraw the screen from top 
 to bottom. NTSC television systems have a refresh rate of approximately 
 60 Hz, whereas computer displays typically have refresh rates of 75 Hz 
 or more. At refresh rates of 70 Hz and lower, screen flicker is often 
 noticeable.<br />
<br />
<strong>Rendering<br />
</strong>Rendering refers to the final drawing stages where the 2D image 
 that appears on a display is derived from its 3D descriptions. What appears 
 on the display may look three dimensional, but it is really just a 2D 
 grid of pixels designed to give the illusion of 3D.<br />
<br />
<strong>Resolution<br />
</strong>The resolution of any display is the number of pixels that can 
 be depicted on screen as specified by the number of horizontal rows against 
 the number of vertical columns. The default VGA resolution of many video 
 cards is capable of displaying 640 rows of pixels by 480 columns. The 
 typical resolution of current displays is set to higher values, such as 
 1024×768 (XGA), 1280×1024 (SXGA), or 1600×1200 (UXGA).</span></p>
<h4><a name="S">S</a></h4>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><strong>Saturation<br />
</strong>Refers to the intensity of a specific hue (color). A highly saturated 
 hue is vivid and intense, whereas a less saturated hue appears more grey. 
 A completely unsaturated color is grey. In terms of the RGB color model, 
 a fully saturated color exists when you have 100% brightness in one of 
 the three channels (say, red) and 0% in the two others (green and blue). 
 Conversely, a fully de-saturated color is one where all of the color values 
 are the same. Saturation can therefore be thought of as the relative difference 
 between the values of the channels.<br />
<br />
<strong>SCART<br />
</strong>Acronym for &quot;Syndicat des Constructeurs d'Appareils Radiorécepteurs 
 et Téléviseurs.&quot; SCART is a 21-pin connector used mainly in Europe 
 for transferring analog audio and video signals between VCRs, DVD players, 
 personal computers, and set-top boxes. It is sometimes referred to as 
 Péritel or the Euroconnector.<br />
<br />
<strong>Scissor Mode<br />
</strong>A graphical load-balancing scheme where two graphics cards are 
 used to render two halves of an image display. One graphics card renders 
 the top half of the screen while the second graphics card renders the 
 bottom half. This configuration offers a form of dynamic load balancing 
 between the two cards as each only needs to render 3D object details on 
 only half of the screen instead of the full screen at any one time. This 
 type of graphical operation is only available in AMD CrossFire graphics 
 cards running Direct 3D and OpenGL games or applications. <br />
<br />
<strong>SDTV<br />
</strong>Acronym for &quot;Standard Definition Television.&quot; This term 
 identifies lower resolution systems when compared to High Definition Television 
 (HDTV) systems. SDTV systems use the same 4:3 aspect ratio and 480 scan 
 lines to produce a picture as regular analog television sets, but digital 
 decoding enhances the signal, displaying a sharper and crisper picture. 
 SDTV broadcasts are either interlaced (480i) or use progressive scan (480p), 
 the latter method providing the best overall image quality.<br />
<br />
<strong>SECAM<br />
</strong>An analog color video signal that originated in France and is 
 used in many other countries, including (but not limited to) much of Eastern 
 Europe, parts of the Middle East, and Asia. Like the PAL video standard, 
 SECAM also draws a total of 625 vertical interlaced frames of video at 
 a refresh rate of 25 Hz, but it uses a fundamentally different way of 
 encoding its colors. The name is an acronym for &quot;Séquential Couleur 
 avec Mémoire,&quot; which is French for &quot;sequential color with memory.&quot;<br />
<br />
<strong>Shadow Mask<br />
</strong>A metal plate full of tiny holes that is attached to the inside 
 of the glass screen in CRT monitors. It focuses the beams from the electron 
 guns at the back of the CRT. The distance between these holes is called 
 the dot pitch.<br />
<br />
<strong>SmartGart™ Diagnostic Tool<br />
</strong>SmartGart is AMD's proprietary diagnostic tool that determines 
 the user’s optimal AGP settings to ensure maximum stability. One significant 
 cause of system hangs is the quality of the AGP bus. Since there are many 
 types of AGP chipsets controlling the bus, the compatibility of the AGP 
 bus varies, and it is difficult to pre-determine its quality through the 
 display driver. With SmartGart, the driver will automatically test the 
 AGP compatibility upon its initialization and dynamically switch to or 
 set up the AGP bus based on the test results. This helps improve system 
 stability..<br />
<br />
<strong>SmartShader™ HD Technology<br />
</strong>A technology that contains advanced vertex and pixel-shading capabilities. 
 A shader is a small program that runs on the GPU and describes how an 
 image should be rendered. Vertex shaders manipulate the individual polygons 
 that make up 3D objects, and pixel shaders operate on the individual pixels 
 that fill in these polygons to create a visible image. SmartShader HD 
 is designed to alleviate the resource constraints of earlier shader hardware, 
 paving the way for more complex, detailed, and realistic shader effects 
 in applications requiring high-performance 3D rendering.<br />
<br />
<strong>SmoothVision™ HD Technology<br />
</strong>A technology that incorporates improved anti-aliasing, anisotropic 
 filtering, and 3DC compression features designed to further enhance image 
 quality. Anti-aliasing performance is improved, providing better overall 
 detail and image quality. The enhanced anisotropic filtering ensures sharper 
 and clearer pictures at higher frame rates, and the new 3DC compression 
 technology makes it possible to display higher polygon counts for 3D rendered 
 objects.<br />
<br />
<strong>Stereoscopic 3D<br />
</strong>Refers to a technique for creating or enhancing the illusion of 
 depth in an image by presenting two offset images separately to the left 
 and right eye of the viewer. These two-dimensional images are then combined 
 in the brain to give the perception of 3-D depth. </p>
<p><strong>Super Anti-aliasing<br />
</strong>A feature that improves image quality by combining the results 
 of full-screen anti-aliasing across two graphics cards in an AMD CrossFire™ 
 configuration. The two graphics cards work on different anti-aliasing 
 patterns within each frame. The results are combined by the graphics cards 
 to produce 3D images featuring smoother contours, lines, and shading effects. 
 <br />
<br />
<strong>SuperTiling<br />
</strong>A graphical load-balancing scheme where two graphics cards are 
 used to render alternate small 32×32 pixel squares in a fine-grained checkerboard 
 pattern. This configuration increases image rendering quality, as each 
 card processes half of the complex 3D objects in the pixel squares. SuperTiling 
 is better optimized for most applications than Scissor Mode (where two 
 graphics cards are used to render the top and bottom halves of the screen), 
 since the checkerboard pattern provides a more even distribution of what 
 needs to be rendered. This type of graphical operation is only available 
 in AMD CrossFire graphics cards running DirectX games or applications.<br />
<br />
<strong>S-Video<br />
</strong>Short for &quot;Separate Video,&quot; S-Video is a type of analog 
 video interface that produces a higher-quality signal compared to composite 
 video. The signal is split into two separate channels—luminance (Y) and 
 chrominance (C). Sometimes referred to as &quot;Y/C video&quot; or &quot;Y/C,&quot; 
 the connectors typically contain 4-pins within a single connection housing 
 and are commonly found on consumer DVD players, VCRs, game consoles, and 
 related devices.</p>
<h4><a name="T">T</a></h4>
<p><span id="DeltaPlaceHolderMain16"><strong>Tear Free Desktop (TFD)<br />
</strong>Reduces the tearing of images in video, 3D graphics, and windowed 
 applications in Linux environment. When enabled, TFD requires additional 
 graphics adapter resources. This feature can be enabled within Linux Catalyst 
 Control Center.<br />
<br />
<strong>Texel<br />
</strong>Short for &quot;texture element,&quot; the 3D equivalent of a 
 pixel, describing the base unit of the surface of a 3D object, such as 
 a sphere; for a 2D object, such as a circle, the base unit is a pixel. 
 <br />
<br />
<strong>Texture Mapping<br />
</strong>In computer graphics, two-dimensional textured surfaces are referred 
 to as texture maps. Texture mapping is the process by which a two-dimensional 
 surface gets wrapped around a three-dimensional object so that the 3D 
 object takes on the same texture qualities. For example, if you take a 
 2D textured surface that looks like cloth and wrap it around a 3D sphere, 
 the sphere will now appear to have a cloth-like surface. <br />
<br />
<strong>Texture Preference<br />
</strong>A feature enabling the user to select the texture quality level 
 for the surface of a 3D object. Selecting the highest quality possible 
 will provide the most realism, although it may also have some impact on 
 the performance of any 3D intensive application.<br />
<br />
<strong>Transition Minimized Differential Signaling (TMDS)<br />
</strong>A technology designed to reduce electromagnetic interference (EMI) 
 and improve the digital signal delivered to flat panel displays. Its encoding 
 algorithm converts the original 8-bit graphic data into a more fault-tolerant 
 10-bit signal, which is then converted back to its original 8-bit form 
 at the display device. The signal is also DC-balanced, allowing for the 
 option of transmitting the signal over fibre-optic cable. DVI connectors 
 can incorporate up to two TMDS links, with each &quot;link&quot; comprised 
 of the number of signals required for standard RGB output. Higher resolutions 
 and refresh rates than standard are possible if multiple TMDS links are 
 available by using multiple DVI connectors. <br />
<br />
<strong>Trilinear Filtering<br />
</strong>A sampling method used to produce realistic-looking 3D objects. 
 Trilinear filtering averages one of the bilinear filter mipmap levels 
 along with the standard mipmap samples.</span></p>

<p><strong>Vari-Bright™ Technology<br />
</strong>An AMD technology designed to optimize notebook panel brightness 
 in order to save power. It allows for direct control of the notebook brightness 
 level to prolong battery life.<br />
<br />
<strong>Vertex Shader<br />
</strong>Three-dimensional objects displayed on a screen are rendered using 
 polygons, each of which is made up of intersecting triangles. A vertex 
 is a corner of a triangle where it connects to another triangle, and each 
 vertex carries a considerable amount of information describing its coordinates 
 in 3D space, as well as its weight, color, texture coordinates, fog, and 
 point size data. A vertex shader is a graphics processing function that 
 manipulates these values, producing such things as more realistic lighting 
 effects, improved complex textures such as hair and fur, and more accurate 
 surface deformations such as waves rippling in a pool or the stretching 
 and wrinkling of a character’s clothes as he or she moves.</p>
<p><strong>VGA Connector<br />
</strong>A type of graphics connector, sometimes also called an analog 
 connector. It is the most common type of video connector available, consisting 
 of 15-pins set in three rows. The &quot;VGA&quot; is an acronym for &quot;Video 
 Graphics Array,&quot; which is also the name for the video resolution 
 mode of 640×480 pixels, the lowest standard resolution supported by virtually 
 all video cards.</p>
<p><strong>Video RAM <br />
</strong>The RAM memory of the video adapter. The amount of video RAM determines 
 what resolutions in a particular color mode an adapter supports. <br />
<br />
<strong>VPU Recover<br />
</strong>A feature designed to significantly reduce the number of system 
 crashes caused by problems occurring with the graphics hardware. If the 
 display driver detects that the graphics processor has hung, VPU Recover 
 will attempt to reset the graphics processor, eliminating the need for 
 a system reboot and allowing users to continue using the computer without 
 interrupting or losing their work.</p>

<h4><a name="Y">Y</a></h4>
<p><span id="DeltaPlaceHolderMain20"><strong>YPbPr<br />
</strong>A type of analog composite video signal that splits and compresses 
 the standard Red/Green/Blue (RGB) colors of a television signal into separate 
 luminance and color values. The &quot;Y&quot; stands for the luminance 
 channel, while &quot;Pb&quot; and &quot;Pr&quot; represent the blue and 
 red channels respectively, both of which have the luminance value subtracted 
 from them. It is an equivalent color space to the chrominance-based YCbCr, 
 which is used for digital video.</span></p>
<h4><a name="Z">Z</a></h4>
<p><span id="DeltaPlaceHolderMain21"><strong>Z-buffer<br />
